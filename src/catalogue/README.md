[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative/tree/master/src/catalogue)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-cloudnative/tree/master/src/catalogue)

A microservices demo service that provides catalogue/product information stored on Oracle Autonomous Database.

### API Spec

Checkout the API Spec [here](https://mushop.docs.apiary.io)

### To build this service:


#### Go tools
In order to build the project locally you need to make sure that the repository directory is located in the correct
$GOPATH directory: $GOPATH/src/mushop/catalogue/. Once that is in place you can build by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/mushop/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/
GO111MODULE=on go build -o catalogue
```

The result is a binary named `catalogue`, in the current directory.

#### Docker
`docker-compose build`

### To run the service on port 8081

#### Go native

If you followed to Go build instructions, you should have a "catalogue" binary in $GOPATH/src/mushop/catalogue/cmd/cataloguesvc/.
To run it use:
```
./catalogue
```

Note: When doing development and running local, you need to set the variables to connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database. OADB_USER, OADB_PW and OADB_SERVICE need to be load as environment variables. Using [.env](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/) file or EXPORT.

#### Docker
`docker-compose up`

### Check whether the service is alive
`curl http://localhost:8081/health`

### Use the service endpoints
`curl http://localhost:8081/catalogue`

## Test Zipkin

To test with Zipkin

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-zipkin.yml up
```
It takes about 10 seconds to seed data

you should see it at:
[http://localhost:9411/](http://localhost:9411)

be sure to hit the "Find Traces" button.  You may need to reload the page.

when done you can run:
